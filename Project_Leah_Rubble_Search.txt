# --- Project Leah: Rubble Search (SAR Indoor) Preset ---
# Purpose: Low sensitivity, high stability, crash recovery enabled.

# 1. THROTTLE SCALING (Precision)
# Limits power to 60% for fine altitude control indoors.
set throttle_limit_type = SCALE
set throttle_limit_percent = 60

# 2. CRASH RECOVERY (Safety)
# If the drone bumps a wall, it will try to self-level instead of disarming.
set crash_recovery = ON

# 3. SMOOTH RATES (Adrenaline Filter)
# Lowers stick sensitivity to prevent jittery movements.
set roll_rc_rate = 50
set pitch_rc_rate = 50
set yaw_rc_rate = 50
set roll_expo = 40
set pitch_expo = 40
set yaw_expo = 30

# 4. NAVIGATION
# Ensures the drone is ready for Angle/Horizon mode usage.

♤ ESC Settings (Motor Torque)
​Crucial Step: For rubble environments, you need "grip" and torque, not smoothness.
•​Open BLHeliSuite32 or ESC-Configurator.
​Read Settings.
​•Change PWM Frequency to 24kHz.
​•Why? 24kHz provides maximum low-end torque. It prevents the drone from "washing out" in tight corners or turbulent air.
​Write/Save Settings.
​  
♤Battery Calibration (Safety)
​•Crucial Step: Do not fly blind. You must know exactly when to turn back.
​•Plug in a fully charged battery.
​•Go to the Power & Battery tab in Betaflight.
​•Compare the "Voltage" reading to your battery voltage (e.g., 16.8V for 4S, 25.2V for 6S).
​•Adjust the Scale until they match perfectly.
​Save. 

♠ Signal Integrity (Crucial for Concrete/Rubble)
• VTX Power: Set to **MAX** available (800mW or >1W recommended). Low power = video loss behind walls.
• OSD Elements: Enable **Link Quality (LQ)** and **RSSI dBm**. Do not rely on RSSI %.
• Warning: If LQ drops below 70, turn back immediately.
