# Leah-SAR: Extreme Environment FPV Presets

**Leah-SAR** is an open-source project dedicated to developing high-reliability FPV drone presets for **Search and Rescue (SAR)** operations and **humanitarian aid missions in Ukraine**. 

Our goal is to ensure drone operators in critical, high-stakes environments can rely on their equipment to perform in extreme weather and signal conditions.

## 🚁 Project Mission
* **Reliability:** Presets tuned for stability and signal penetration rather than racing speed.
* **Accessibility:** Creating a "Field Operations Mode" to make complex configuration easy for pilots in the field.
* **Resilience:** Optimized for harsh environments, including high winds, cold temperatures, and areas with heavy RF interference.

## ⚙️ Key Features
* **Extreme Environment Presets:** Pre-configured CLI settings for Betaflight that prioritize link quality and motor reliability.
* **Field Operations Mode:** (In Development) A simplified interface for the Betaflight Configurator to assist rapid deployment.
* **Disaster Relief Focus:** Tested and tuned for the specific needs of SAR teams and aid delivery.

## 🚀 Getting Started
*Note: This project is currently in active development.*

1.  **Check your Hardware:** Ensure your flight controller and ESC firmware are up to date.
2.  **Download the Preset:** Navigate to the [Releases] page (coming soon) to download the latest CLI dump.
3.  **Apply in Betaflight:** Copy the text and paste it into the CLI tab of the Betaflight Configurator. **Always backup your current configuration first.**

## 🤝 Contributing
We welcome contributions from the FPV community! 
* **Testers:** If you fly in extreme cold or high interference areas, please report your results in the **Discussions** tab.
* **Developers:** Help us refine the Betaflight Configurator integration.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
These presets are experimental and intended for specific use cases. Always test in a controlled environment before deploying in a mission-critical scenario.
